                    <br/><i>Automate your network. Because ain't nobody got time to manually configure every

                <br/><br/><h5>What is Network Automation?</h5>
                <p>
                    Have you ever found yourself buried under a mountain of repetitive network configuration tasks, 
                    wishing there was a better way? Network automation is like having a helpful robot that takes care of 
                    repetitive tasks in your computer network. Instead of doing everything by hand, like setting up connections 
                    or fixing problems, this robot does it for you quickly and accurately. With network automation, you can focus on the 
                    important stuff while the robot handles the rest, making your network more efficient and reliable.
                </p>

                <br/><br/><h5>But why automate your network when, say, configuring a VLAN can be done with just a two-line command?</h5>
                <p>
                    In today's fast-paced world of networking, where time is money and mistakes can be costly, automation is 
                    like having a superhero on your team. Instead of spending hours typing commands and hoping for the best, 
                    automation swoops in to save the day. 
                    <br/>Now you may ask, <b>why write a code that'll take longer to write than 
                    configuring, say a VLAN on a switch manually? Isn't this much faster?</b>

                    <img class="medium-image" src = "/static/assets/no_automation.png"/>

                    <br/><br/>Yes, you're correct! Configuring a VLAN on one switch manually is 100% faster than writing a code to configure it.
                    However, what if you were to configure a VLAN on 100 switches? Or 1000 switches? Or a million switches?
                    Network automation offers far-reaching benefits beyond convenience. It transforms network management by ensuring 
                    consistency, reducing human error, and enabling efficient scaling of operations. In essence, while a two-line command 
                    might suffice for a single VLAN, automation empowers organizations to unlock the full 
                    potential of their networks, enabling agility, resilience, and innovation.

                </p>

                <br/><br/><h5>So do I automate everything?</h5>
                    <p>
                        <b>Automate when you can, script when you must.</b>
                        <br/>
                        Automate when you can: Utilize available tooling to simplify network automation tasks. Instead 
                        of starting from scratch, prioritize leveraging versatile tools, like Ansible, Puppet, Chef, etc. 
                        The aim is to automate approximately 80% of network tasks.
                        <br/><br/>
                        <img class = "small-image" src = "/static/assets/automateverything.jpeg"/>
                        <br/><br/>
                        Script when you must: Resort to scripting when existing automation tools become inadequate or overly complex for 
                        specific operations. Scripting involves creating custom modules or enhancing existing ones within tools. 
                        This doesn't demand extensive programming skills.
                    </p>

                <br/><br/><h5>Well, does this mean network automation's aim is to replace humans with machines? What about my job?</h5>
                <p>
            
                    Automating your network isn't about replacing people with machines; it's about 
                    empowering you and your team to tackle more strategic initiatives and drive business growth.
                    <br/>
                    Automation takes care of repetitive and mundane tasks, allowing network engineers like us to 
                    focus on higher-value activities that require human creativity, problem-solving, and critical 
                    thinking skills.
                    <br/><br/>
                    <img class="medium-image" src = "/static/assets/Robot-Workers.png"/>
                    <br/><br/>
                    Our role as a network engineer remains crucial in designing, implementing, and maintaining 
                    network infrastructure. While automation streamlines certain aspects of network management, 
                    it doesn't eliminate the need for human oversight and decision-making. In fact, automation 
                    often enhances job opportunities by increasing the efficiency and scalability of network operations.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Moreover, network automation can have a significant impact on both capital expenditure (CapEx) and operational 
                    expenditure (OpEx). By automating routine tasks, organizations can reduce the need for manual labor and the 
                    associated labor costs, leading to OpEx savings.
                    <br/> 
                    <img class="small-image" src = "/static/assets/capex-opex.webp">
                    <br/>
                    However, it's essential to consider the broader picture. 
                    While automation may lead to workforce reductions in some areas, it often creates new job opportunities in others. 
                    For example, as organizations implement automation in network management, they may require skilled professionals 
                    to design, implement, and maintain the automated systems. Additionally, automation can free up human resources to 
                    focus on more strategic and complex tasks that require creativity, problem-solving skills, and domain expertise.
                    Additionally, automation can improve resource utilization and 
                    optimize infrastructure deployment, resulting in lower CapEx expenses over time.

                <br/><br/><h5>My experience with network automation</h5>
                <p>
                    During my work experience, much of the network configuration was performed manually, leading to significant 
                    operational overhead. Many network engineers hesitate to automate due to the time and effort required to set 
                    up automation infrastructure. Additionally, many network engineers hesitate to automate due to either a lack 
                    of expertise in automation techniques or the perceived effort required to shift from manual to automated processes. 
                    However, my perspective shifted during my master's degree when I explored network automation.
                    <br/><br/>
                    <img class = "small-image" src = "/static/assets/industry.jpeg"/>
                    <br/><br/>
                    I realized its potential for streamlining tasks and boosting efficiency. For example, I developed a script to 
                    automate BGP, OSPF, and DHCP configuration on multiple routers, simplifying the process and saving time. 
                    Additionally, I created modular components for tasks like router connectivity and SSH access, enhancing the 
                    functionality of my automation scripts. These experiences demonstrated the power of network automation in 
                    optimizing operational workflows.

                <br/><br/><h5>Okay, I'm convinced. But how do I automate my network now?</h5>
                <p>
                    You've come to the right place! In the upcoming articles, I will write about <b>what</b> to automate
                    and how to setup a basic infrastructure. I'll be using GNS3 and Python to automate
                    the infrastructure. It's quick and easy to follow. 
                    Trust me, with this, you won't ever have to touch the CLI (<i>or maybe a little</i>). Stay tuned and 
                    happy automating!
